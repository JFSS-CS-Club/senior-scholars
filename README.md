# JFSS CS Senior Scholars

This will be the main workspace for the senior scholars team. This year is particularly special, so we will be trying our best to help you when teachers may be unavailable.

## How does it work?

It's pretty simple! If you want to ask a question, need help with your code, or have any other concerns, just create an issue in this Github repository by going to the [issues page](https://github.com/JFSS-CS-Club/senior-scholars/issues/new/choose).

We will be using the issues page to store all of our request, and we will try our best to assign an available senior scholar to your request within a few hours.

### What should my issue/request look like?

Help us help you! When you create an issue, you should be asked to choose from a list of issue templates. 

Click **Get started** on the **Request for help** issue template.

Make sure to fill out as much of the issue template as you can.
